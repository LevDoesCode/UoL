# What shape is your data?
## Sorts of structure
* Structures in programming environments
* Structures in data models
* Structures in serializations (data formats)
* Structures in exchange protocols
* Structures in user interfaces

## Shapes available
* Tables
* Trees
* Graphs
* Media (raw data)
* Documents/objects

# Tables
## What does a table look like?
A table can be seen as a collection of cells where each _row_ represents a thing and each column represents a type of information about the thing.

A strength of a table is that it's easy to understand, search and communicate meaning.

However, conveying hierarchy cannot be done.

# Trees
They have only one parent node instead of two in family trees.
The root node is represented at the top in diagrams.

# Other
Tree nodes can only have one parent at the most. However, when there start to be more parents for a node, we're now talking about a graph.

Tables: General-purpose
Trees: Heterogeneous and hierarchical, structured data
Graphs: Heterogeneous, non-hierarchical, structured data
Blobs: Inaccessible data for storage
Features: Searchable information derived from blobs
Documents: Rich, but not interrelated data

# Summary
* Where does your data come from?
* How well does it fit your needs?
* How is it structured?
* How well can it be integrated?
* How should your data be structured?
* How will you use yoru data?
* Will others use your data?
